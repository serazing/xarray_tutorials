Tutorials for xarray
====================

This repository stores useful tutorials to perform computation in oceanography with dask_ and xarray_.

Dask_ provides parallel computation on multi-dimensional arrays using a task scheduler. Xarray_ provides a flexible use of the netCDF files as it has a similar in-memory representation for the data. Xarray_ also relies on pandas_ and benefits from the timeseries and groupby operation implemented in pandas_. All the

Installation
